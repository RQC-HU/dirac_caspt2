-m64     generate code for Intel(R) 64 architecture

-mkl[=<arg>]
          link to the Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (Intel(R) MKL) and bring
          in the associated headers
            parallel   - link using the threaded Intel(R) MKL libraries. This
                         is the default when -mkl is specified
            sequential - link using the non-threaded Intel(R) MKL libraries
            cluster    - link using the Intel(R) MKL Cluster libraries plus
                         the sequential Intel(R) MKL libraries

-qopenmp  enable the compiler to generate multi-threaded code based on the
          OpenMP* directives (same as -fopenmp)
          Use -qno-openmp to disable

-mp1      improve floating-point precision

-e90      issue errors for language elements that are not standard in
          Fortran 90 (same as -stand f90 -warn stderrors options)


-integer-size <size>
          specifies the default size of integer and logical variables
            size:  16, 32, 64

-real-size <size>
          specify the size of REAL and COMPLEX declarations, constants,
          functions, and intrinsics
            size: 32, 64, 128
